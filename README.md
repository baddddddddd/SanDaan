## 🔍 Introduction

Commuting can be a stressful and time-consuming process, with traffic conditions and other unforeseen events often causing delays and frustration. Additionally, the transportation sector is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. To address these challenges, a navigation app for commuters will be developed.

This project aims to develop an app-based navigation system that will help commuters in Batangas City to travel efficiently. The app will provide accurate and up-to-date information on transportation schedules, traffic conditions, and directions, making it easier for users to plan their journeys and promoting sustainable transportation solutions.

Furthermore, the app-based navigation system can contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 11, which aims to make cities and human settlements more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, and SDG 13, which seeks to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. By promoting sustainable transportation solutions and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the app-based navigation system can make a valuable contribution towards achieving these global goals.


## 🌏 Problem Statement

Despite the rapid advancement of technology and the information we have access to, many people still lack accessible information about sustainable transportation. Public transit remains the primary means of transportation for many, making it crucial to provide easily accessible information on options that support SDGs 11 and 13.

</a>

SDG 13 aims to tackle climate change and its effects as soon as possible. Transportation is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, making the shift to more environmentally friendly means of transportation crucial to achieving this goal. Promoting sustainable transportation options can reduce the carbon footprint of transportation systems and mitigate the effects of climate change.

Currently, there is a lack of tools that use information about the schedules, routes, and usage of public transportation to offer environmentally friendly options to users. This restricts people from making informed decisions that align with global sustainable development goals. A technology that can effectively compile information on available public transportation options, analyze it, and offer consumers personalized recommendations for more environmentally friendly solutions is needed to address this problem. Such a tool would support the global effort to attain SDGs 11 and 13 by promoting environmentally friendly transportation and reducing carbon emissions.


## 🌱 Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to help people by developing a mobile-based application that promotes the use of efficient and environmentally-friendly public transportation routes. This will be accomplished by providing accurate and real-time information on public transportation schedules, routes, and various options available to commuters. The app will enable users to easily search for transportation options based on their location, destination, and travel time preferences. Additionally, a community-driven system will be incorporated into the app, allowing users to share their preferred routes based on previous travels and preferences, and make them accessible to other users.

This system is expected to not only make public transportation more accessible and efficient for users but also encourage more individuals to contribute to this feature and keep the project relevant over an extended period. By promoting sustainable transportation options, the project will contribute towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 11, which emphasizes making cities and human settlements more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. Ultimately, the mobile application will help people choose the best transportation options, reduce travel time and cost, and minimize the environmental impact of public transportation.
